# SPDM Composition Models

Anonymized


## Tamarin
To analyze the SPDM composition models, we used the `develop` branch of
Tamarin prover [https://github.com/tamarin-prover/tamarin-prover/tree/develop](https://github.com/tamarin-prover/tamarin-prover/tree/develop).

You can see the concrete git revision we used to produce our results below

## Instructions

### Dependencies
To install all dependencies on Ubuntu for the `tamarin_wrapper.py` file, run

```bash
apt-get install python3
apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install tabulate matplotlib
```

### Execution

Simply run

```bash
sh case_studies.sh
```

### Results

Compare the results in the `results` folder with the precomputed results in `baseline`


### Troubleshooting

In case you face any timeouts within the results, you can increase the `TIMEOUT` value in the `case_studies.sh` and run it again
